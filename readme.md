# 3D Protein Model Site

This is my second project in which I wanted to create the possibility of visualizing models of protein structures in 3D. As you can see, I managed to achieve this. It was very good journey, I learned a lot from doing this.

After a month, as in the case of the first project, I introduce an improvement in performance.

Before the site was loading 17.5mb transferred and 20mb resources and finish time was 42s.

After optimization it takes only 3.5mb transferred and 5.3mb resources. The finish time is ~4-5s.

Tools: Three.js, JavaScript, html, css, blender, webpack, node.js
